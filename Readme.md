# Learning Rust

This repository is a collection of notes, exercises, and projects that I have worked on as part of my journey to learn Rust programming language.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency. It helps developers write safe and efficient code by ensuring memory safety without needing a garbage collector. Itâ€™s widely used in building high-performance software, including operating systems, web servers, and more.

## Topics Covered

- Basic syntax and data types
- Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- Functions and closures
- Error handling with `Result` and `Option`
- Structs and enums
- Concurrency with threads
- Rust tooling (Cargo, rustfmt, Clippy)

## Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

## Progress

- Week 1: Getting familiar with Rust syntax and basic concepts.
- Week 2: Started working with ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- Week 3: Implemented basic error handling and concurrency examples.

Feel free to follow along and contribute to my learning!
